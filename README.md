# Dukebot

Discord bot written in Node.js, using the [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/) library

## Requirements

You'll need git and Node.js. Currently using version 12.14.0 of Node

## Good Resources

You should probably at least skim these before starting work

- https://discordjs.guide/
- https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome

## Install

Use your preferred method of cloning and then run:

    $ npm install

## Configure app

Set environment variables seen in `configService.js`

## Running the project

    $ npm run dev

It uses [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) so it'll restart the app automatically once any changes are detected.
